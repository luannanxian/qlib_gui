<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Qlib</span></code> is an AI-oriented quantitative investment platform, which aims to realize the potential, empower the research, and create the value of AI technologies in quantitative investment.</p>
<p>With <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Qlib</span></code>, users can easily try their ideas to create better Quant investment strategies.</p>

<h2>Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#framework" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<img alt="../_images/framework.svg" class="align-center" src="../_images/framework.svg"/><p>At the module level, Qlib is a platform that consists of above components. The components are designed as loose-coupled modules and each component could be used stand-alone.</p>
<p>This framework may be intimidating for new users to Qlib. It tries to accurately include a lot of details of Qlib’s design.
For users new to Qlib, you can skip it first and read it later.</p>

<cite>DataServer</cite> provides high-performance infrastructure for users to manage

<td><p>The <cite>Forecast Model</cite> and <cite>Trading Agent</cite> are trainable. They are trained
based on the <cite>Learning Framework</cite> layer and then applied to multiple scenarios
in <cite>Workflow</cite> layer. The supported learning paradigms can be categorized into
reinforcement learning and supervised learning.  The learning framework
leverages the <cite>Workflow</cite> layer as well(e.g. sharing <cite>Information Extractor</cite>,
creating environments based on <cite>Execution Env</cite>).</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p><cite>Workflow</cite> layer</p></td>
<td><p><cite>Workflow</cite> layer covers the whole workflow of quantitative investment.
Both supervised-learning-based strategies and RL-based Strategies
are supported.
<cite>Information Extractor</cite> extracts data for models. <cite>Forecast Model</cite> focuses
on producing all kinds of forecast signals (e.g. <em>alpha</em>, risk) for other
modules.  With these signals <cite>Decision Generator</cite> will generate the target
trading decisions(i.e. portfolio, orders)
If RL-based Strategies are adopted, the <cite>Policy</cite> is learned in a end-to-end way,
the trading decisions are generated directly.
Decisions will be executed by <cite>Execution Env</cite>
(i.e. the trading market).  There may be multiple levels of <cite>Strategy</cite>
and <cite>Executor</cite> (e.g. an <em>order executor trading strategy and intraday order executor</em>
could behave like an interday trading loop and be nested in
<em>daily portfolio management trading strategy and interday trading executor</em>
trading loop)</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p><cite>Interface</cite> layer</p></td>

forecasting signals, portfolios and execution results</p></td>
